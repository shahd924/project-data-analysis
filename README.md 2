Introduction
This project analyzes diabetes patient data using the Gaussian Naive Bayes model. It aims to explore the relationship between health features and diabetes outcomes, enhancing predictions and health interventions.
Objectives
•	Data Exploration: Understand dataset structure and feature relationships.
•	Feature Analysis: Identify key features affecting diabetes likelihood.
•	Model Development: Implement Gaussian Naive Bayes for outcome prediction.
•	Performance Evaluation: Assess model accuracy and F1 score.
•	Insights Generation: Provide recommendations for healthcare professionals.
Dataset Columns
•	Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies.
•	Glucose: Blood glucose level.
•	BloodPressure: Blood pressure.
•	SkinThickness: Skin thickness.
•	Insulin: Insulin level.
•	BMI: Body Mass Index.
•	DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Genetic function related to diabetes.
•	Age: Age of the patient.
•	Outcome: Result (0: no diabetes, 1: diabetes).
Model
•	Name: Gaussian Naive Bayes
•	Reasons for Use:
o	Simple and easy to understand.
o	Good performance with independent features.
o	Fast training and prediction.
o	Handles imbalanced datasets well.
Performance Metrics
•	Accuracy: 76.62%
•	F1 Score: 76.45%
Results
The model shows good performance in predicting diabetes presence, evaluated via confusion matrix and classification report.
