This project aims to analyze the order data of an online store using data analytics tools like seaborn, Pandas, mlxtend to understand customer behavior and orders.

Data Used
We use a set of files containing different data:

aisles.csv: Information about the aisles in the store.
departments.csv: Details about the different departments in the store.
order_products_prior.csv: Information about the products that were previously ordered.
order_products_train.csv: Training data for orders.
orders.csv: Information about the orders.
products.csv: Details about the products.
Analysis Steps
Data Collection: Importing data about orders, products, and departments from CSV files.
Data Exploration: Using head() and info() functions to examine the data and understand its structure.
Data Cleaning: Removing missing or duplicate values ​​using drop_duplicates() and fillna().
Applying FP-Growth Algorithm: To extract recurring patterns from large datasets.
Visualization: Using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot graphs to better understand the results.

Results
The number of products in each section was determined to see which section had the most products.
The number of orders for each day of the week was analyzed.
The top five selling products and the bottom five selling products were identified.
The shopping cart data was analyzed using the FP-Growth algorithm.
